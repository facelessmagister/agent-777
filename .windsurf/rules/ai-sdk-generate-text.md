# Generating and Streaming Text

Large language models (LLMs) can generate text in response to a prompt, which can contain instructions and information to process.
For example, you can ask a model to come up with a recipe, draft an email, or summarize a document.

The AI SDK Core provides two functions to generate text and stream it from LLMs:

- [`generateText`](#generatetext): Generates text for a given prompt and model.
- [`streamText`](#streamtext): Streams text from a given prompt and model.

Advanced LLM features such as [tool calling](./tools-and-tool-calling) and [structured data generation](./generating-structured-data) are built on top of text generation.

## `generateText`

You can generate text using the [`generateText`](/docs/reference/ai-sdk-core/generate-text) function. This function is ideal for non-interactive use cases where you need to write text (e.g. drafting email or summarizing web pages) and for agents that use tools.

```tsx
import { generateText } from 'ai';

const { text } = await generateText({
  model: 'openai/gpt-4.1',
  prompt: 'Write a vegetarian lasagna recipe for 4 people.',
});
```

You can use more [advanced prompts](./prompts) to generate text with more complex instructions and content:

```tsx
import { generateText } from 'ai';

const { text } = await generateText({
  model: 'openai/gpt-4.1',
  system:
    'You are a professional writer. ' +
    'You write simple, clear, and concise content.',
  prompt: `Summarize the following article in 3-5 sentences: ${article}`,
});
```

The result object of `generateText` contains several promises that resolve when all required data is available:

- `result.content`: The content that was generated in the last step.
- `result.text`: The generated text.
- `result.reasoning`: The full reasoning that the model has generated in the last step.
- `result.reasoningText`: The reasoning text of the model (only available for some models).
- `result.files`: The files that were generated in the last step.
- `result.sources`: Sources that have been used as references in the last step (only available for some models).
- `result.toolCalls`: The tool calls that were made in the last step.
- `result.toolResults`: The results of the tool calls from the last step.
- `result.finishReason`: The reason the model finished generating text.
- `result.usage`: The usage of the model during the final step of text generation.
- `result.totalUsage`: The total usage across all steps (for multi-step generations).
- `result.warnings`: Warnings from the model provider (e.g. unsupported settings).
- `result.request`: Additional request information.
- `result.response`: Additional response information, including response messages and body.
- `result.providerMetadata`: Additional provider-specific metadata.
- `result.steps`: Details for all steps, useful for getting information about intermediate steps.
- `result.experimental_output`: The generated structured output using the `experimental_output` specification.

### Accessing response headers & body

Sometimes you need access to the full response from the model provider,
e.g. to access some provider-specific headers or body content.

You can access the raw response headers and body using the `response` property:

```ts
import { generateText } from 'ai';

const result = await generateText({
  // ...
});

console.log(JSON.stringify(result.response.headers, null, 2));
console.log(JSON.stringify(result.response.body, null, 2));
```

## `streamText`

Depending on your model and prompt, it can take a large language model (LLM) up to a minute to finish generating its response. This delay can be unacceptable for interactive use cases such as chatbots or real-time applications, where users expect immediate responses.

AI SDK Core provides the [`streamText`](/docs/reference/ai-sdk-core/stream-text) function which simplifies streaming text from LLMs:

```ts
import { streamText } from 'ai';

const result = streamText({
  model: 'openai/gpt-4.1',
  prompt: 'Invent a new holiday and describe its traditions.',
});

// example: use textStream as an async iterable
for await (const textPart of result.textStream) {
  console.log(textPart);
}
```

<Note>
  `result.textStream` is both a `ReadableStream` and an `AsyncIterable`.
</Note>

<Note type="warning">
  `streamText` immediately starts streaming and suppresses errors to prevent
  server crashes. Use the `onError` callback to log errors.
</Note>

You can use `streamText` on its own or in combination with [AI SDK
UI](/examples/next-pages/basics/streaming-text-generation) and [AI SDK
RSC](/examples/next-app/basics/streaming-text-generation).
The result object contains several helper functions to make the integration into [AI SDK UI](/docs/ai-sdk-ui) easier:

- `result.toUIMessageStreamResponse()`: Creates a UI Message stream HTTP response (with tool calls etc.) that can be used in a Next.js App Router API route.
- `result.pipeUIMessageStreamToResponse()`: Writes UI Message stream delta output to a Node.js response-like object.
- `result.toTextStreamResponse()`: Creates a simple text stream HTTP response.
- `result.pipeTextStreamToResponse()`: Writes text delta output to a Node.js response-like object.

<Note>
  `streamText` is using backpressure and only generates tokens as they are
  requested. You need to consume the stream in order for it to finish.
</Note>

It also provides several promises that resolve when the stream is finished:

- `result.content`: The content that was generated in the last step.
- `result.text`: The generated text.
- `result.reasoning`: The full reasoning that the model has generated.
- `result.reasoningText`: The reasoning text of the model (only available for some models).
- `result.files`: Files that have been generated by the model in the last step.
- `result.sources`: Sources that have been used as references in the last step (only available for some models).
- `result.toolCalls`: The tool calls that have been executed in the last step.
- `result.toolResults`: The tool results that have been generated in the last step.
- `result.finishReason`: The reason the model finished generating text.
- `result.usage`: The usage of the model during the final step of text generation.
- `result.totalUsage`: The total usage across all steps (for multi-step generations).
- `result.warnings`: Warnings from the model provider (e.g. unsupported settings).
- `result.steps`: Details for all steps, useful for getting information about intermediate steps.
- `result.request`: Additional request information from the last step.
- `result.response`: Additional response information from the last step.
- `result.providerMetadata`: Additional provider-specific metadata from the last step.

### `onError` callback

`streamText` immediately starts streaming to enable sending data without waiting for the model.
Errors become part of the stream and are not thrown to prevent e.g. servers from crashing.

To log errors, you can provide an `onError` callback that is triggered when an error occurs.

```tsx highlight="6-8"
import { streamText } from 'ai';

const result = streamText({
  model: 'openai/gpt-4.1',
  prompt: 'Invent a new holiday and describe its traditions.',
  onError({ error }) {
    console.error(error); // your error logging logic here
  },
});
```

### `onChunk` callback

When using `streamText`, you can provide an `onChunk` callback that is triggered for each chunk of the stream.

It receives the following chunk types:

- `text`
- `reasoning`
- `source`
- `tool-call`
- `tool-input-start`
- `tool-input-delta`
- `tool-result`
- `raw`

```tsx highlight="6-11"
import { streamText } from 'ai';

const result = streamText({
  model: 'openai/gpt-4.1',
  prompt: 'Invent a new holiday and describe its traditions.',
  onChunk({ chunk }) {
    // implement your own logic here, e.g.:
    if (chunk.type === 'text') {
      console.log(chunk.text);
    }
  },
});
```

### `onFinish` callback

When using `streamText`, you can provide an `onFinish` callback that is triggered when the stream is finished (
[API Reference](/docs/reference/ai-sdk-core/stream-text#on-finish)
).
It contains the text, usage information, finish reason, messages, steps, total usage, and more:

```tsx highlight="6-8"
import { streamText } from 'ai';

const result = streamText({
  model: 'openai/gpt-4.1',
  prompt: 'Invent a new holiday and describe its traditions.',
  onFinish({ text, finishReason, usage, response, steps, totalUsage }) {
    // your own logic, e.g. for saving the chat history or recording usage

    const messages = response.messages; // messages that were generated
  },
});
```
